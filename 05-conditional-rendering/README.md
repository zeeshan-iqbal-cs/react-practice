# Rendering List

There are some cases when we want to render content dynamically based upon conditional preference.

This code renders a paragragh if the list is empty.
![full screen shoot ](img/po2.png)
![full screen shoot ](img/po1.png)
But if list contains datait renders HTML list,
![full screen shoot ](img/p2.png)
![full screen shoot ](img/p1.png)
