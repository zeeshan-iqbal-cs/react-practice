# REACT PRACTICE

## Introduction

At the time of writing this, I was learning React from video tutorials of Mosh Hamedani.

I was making this repository to make all of my practice available for me and other community for later use as a reference. Incase there is a need for the lookup for a specific feature.

## Installation

1. Install node package manager 1. On Windows and Mac you can download installer from website. 2. For Ddbian based linux you can install by running following commands.
   <br>
   `suso apt install npm`

2. Install "create-react-app". This module will be used to create app.
   <br>
   `npm i -g create-react-app`

_Now your environment will be ready to go to build application. Dependencies will be install for every folder seperaterly depending upon your need._
